**Timagotchi**

Video Demonstration
==================================================================


![My working project](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zQinjK8Ev_d_P6j7YlRHn3-H0b4sHz7Z)

Overview
=================================================================

The Timagotchi is "pet" that we made to simulate the lives of us at MIT. We missed out on all the functionality we wanted because setting up a login, makings games, and drawing images took more time than we anticipated. We were able to set up the architecture to expand the game even more and in an ideal world our Timagotchi would be able to interact with other players. Currently they have happiness and hunger levels and these are affected by things such as game scores and course number.


Parts
==================================================================

* The ESP32 Dev Board (your microcontroller)
* The TFT Display
* 3 breadboards
* An acryllic back piece
* A USB-A to micro USB cable
* Two button switches
* Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU chip)

Below is an image of the wiring (there's some extra wires in there due to there having been more sensors than necessary):

Accounts
=================================================================

Creating a Timagotchi
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For the initialization of a Timagotchi, there are truly only 2 fields that are needed to be filled in: username and course number. An important thing to note, however, is that each Timagotchi should have a completely unique username compared to all other Timagotchis in the world. Thus, when picking a name, the device checks with the server to ensure that the Timagotchi's name has never been used before. If it has, a new username is made, otherwise, the initialization process continues.

The following videos displays this clearly:

Logging in
------------------------------------------------------------------

Similar to the initialization class for the Timagotchi creation, the login class simply gets user input for a username and checks whether or not it exists in the database.

The key differences in the login page are in its accessibility and UX:

* Two-way scrolling keyboard: Simply put, the user can scroll left or right through the alphabet using single left or right button presses. Additionally, the user can see the next and previous letter, since the alphabet can be hard sometimes
* Error Screen: if the username isn’t found, the user is given a prompt asking if they’d like to try again
* Clear: The user can clear the username that they just typed by double clicking the left button.
* Exit: The user can, at any time, return to the starting “Welcome” page by long pressing the left button.

While these features might not even deserve all this attention, they’re important since they take user tendencies into account, which is very important since this is the system’s bottleneck; every user has to sign in.

Games
===================================================================

Single Player Trivia
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Single Player Trivia parses the a response from the open trivia database (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) using a python proxy endpoint, and sends down a string containing the question, the options, and the answer. We display the question at the top followed by the answer choices. If the player chooses the correct answer a green box will highlight around the answer. The player can keep playing or long press to exit.

While we utilized a display strategy similar to that of the VerticalMenu class, this one had to accommodate for more text and answer feedback
	* We had to use print statements instead of drawing strings to allow for overflow
	* we changed the margins of the cursors
	* most significantly, we added a buzzer function, where once a user selects an answer, the selected answer and the right answer are the only answers shown on the screen:
		* if the user is right, only their selected answer is shown with a green cursor.
		* if the user is wrong, their selected answer remains, with the red cursor, and the correct answer remains, with a green cursor.

By the project deadline the Trivia API (from the Trivia Design Project) we were using was disabled by the owner and at the last minute we were forced to hard code trivia questions to display our game architecture and functionality.

Multiplayer Trivia
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Using a similar scoring mechanism with global leaderboard as discussed more in infinite run, we had designed multiplayer trivia to work virtually the same as Single Player trivia, with global score tracking. Upon correct or incorrect responses, users scores were to be updated, and their scores tracked in a global database so users could track a leaderboard. However, with the trivia API being taken down, we decided it would not add value to our project to have a multiplayer trivia game over a small set of hard coded trivia questions. 


Infinite Run
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Infinite Run is a game the user can play with their timagotchi where they try and dodge obstacles that come through from the top of the screen in random x-positions. This game utilized the imu so that the user could control their x-position on the game by tilting the imu. Here are some of the features:
	* Every obstacle the user passes is a point.
	* Every time the user loses, their max score is recorded and they start a new game. They can leave the game whenever they choose.
	* The user can post their highest score to the server and then check the leaderboard and where they place on it.


An interesting addition to the Infinite Run game is the use of leaderboards. The user can check the top 3 users in the world for Infinite Run. The device will keep track of the user's top score in the server. If that top score surpasses one of the top 3 scores, the user will be put into the leaderboard for all other users to see. 

This is shown in the following video:

Server
====================================================================

![Endpoints](endpointsfinal.png)
For our server, we chose to use Django to power the backend. We chose this so that we could divide up our server across multiple endpoints more easily, as well as easily manage the database, since we have access to the `sqlite3` command line interface on our local machines. Using Django Rest Framework alongside Django, we were able to implement the server with various different endpoints as shown above. The code can be found in the `backend` folder, and the python requirements can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Currently, we run the server locally and use `ngrok` to create an endpoint that is globally accessibe, which allowed us to work around having to use AWS or any other hosting architecture. 

System Architecture
=====================================================================

Object Oriented FSM
---------------------------------------------------------------------

![System Diagram](system_diagram1.png)

Below is our system fsm code. We made different states that allowed us to use different classes/objects, allowing us the further distribute the code among many different files and turn our features into individual objects. In each state, the sensor input (buttons and the imu in the case of infinite run) determine updates in the object in that moment, which returned a nonzero flag when it was time to switch to a different state and different object.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void fsm(int b1_delta, int b2_delta) {
	switch (state) {
	  case LANDING:
		if (b1_delta == -1) {
		  state = LOGIN;
		} else if (b2_delta == -1) {
		  state = INIT;
		}
		break;
	  case LOGIN:
		flag = login.update(b1_delta, b2_delta);
		if (flag == 1) {
		  state = NAV;
		  menu.displayHome();
		  username = login.getUsername();
		} else if (flag == 2) {
		  state = LANDING;
		  drawLandingScreen();
		}
		break;
	  case INIT:
		flag = timCreator.update(b1_delta, b2_delta);
		if (flag != 0) {
		  username = timCreator.getUsername();
		  state = NAV;
		  menu.displayHome();
		}
		break;
	  case NAV:
		flag = menu.update(b1_delta, b2_delta);
		if (flag == single_trivia_flag) {
		  state = SP_TRIVIA;
		  Serial.println("Problem?");
		  sp_trivia.initialize(username, network, password, tft, false);
		} else if (flag == multi_trivia_flag) {
		  state = MP_TRIVIA;
		  //trivia = TriviaGame(multi);
		} else if (flag == infinite_run_flag) {
		  state = INFINITE;
		  imu_activated = true;
		  tft.fillScreen(TFT_WHITE);
		  infinite = InfiniteRun(tft, username, network, password, imu);
		  infinite.step(10);
		} else if (flag == scores_flag) {
		  state = SCORES;
		  drawScoresBool = true;
		}
		break;
	  case SP_TRIVIA:
		flag = sp_trivia.update(b1_delta, b2_delta);
		if (flag != 0) {
		  state = NAV;
		  menu.displayHome();
		}
		break;
	  case MP_TRIVIA:
		//flag = mp_trivia.update(b1_delta, b2_delta);
		if (flag != 0) {
		  state = NAV;
		  menu.displayHome();
		}
		break;
	  case INFINITE:
		flag = 0;
		imu.readAccelData(imu.accelCount);
		infinite.step(float(-imu.accelCount[1] * imu.aRes) * 10);
		if (flag != 0 or b1_delta != 0) {
		  state = NAV;
		  imu_activated = false;
		  menu.displayHome();
		}
		break;
	  case SCORES:
		flag = 0;
		if(drawScoresBool){
		  drawScores();
		  drawScoresBool = false;
		}
		if (flag != 0 or b1_delta != 0) {
		  state = NAV;
		  imu_activated = false;
		  menu.displayHome();
		}
		break;
	}
	if (flag != 0) {
	  Serial.println(flag);
	}
	flag = 0;
  }

Cool Button 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cool Button is an upgraded version of the Nice Button, with short and long presses, that we made in an exercise. produces four different kinds of outputs on every update, which in the diagram are called ‘flags’. These represents what kind of press the user has done with the button: 

* Flag = 0: no press
* Flag = 1: short press
* Flag = 2: long press
* Flag = 3: double click

When used in any process, the flags output by the button are meant to be kept track of, and in every cycle, the current flag should be compared to the old flag; the difference between them determines the button delta, which, when not equal to zero, indicates that something (depending on the integrated system) should happen. Below is the state diagram

![Vertical Menu](CoolButtonDiagram.png)


Menu
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the main vertical menu for the Timagotchi device. The user can toggle between different options using right button short clicks, select items using right button double clicks, and go back to the previous menu using left button double clicks.

Icons
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Icons were only able to be transferred onto the screen if they were black and white images. In order to do so, the images had to be downloaded, transferred to photoshop and retraced with only black pixels on a white background. After doing so, the image had to be exported as .bmp file. This was necessary because we had to convert the BMP file into a char array of pixel values through an online converter. It was crucial that the image was the exact pixel size desired ont he screen because the arrays were not able to be scaled. This was a bit of a hastle as if we desried different scaled images we had to scaled them in photoshop and reconvert. 

After doing so, we moved all of the char arrays into the code and used a drawBitmap function to display it onto the screen. The initial beaver took lots of effort to get right, but after the first 4 or 5 images, we began to get the process of it. The conversion was not always successful as there were not enough pixels to draw smaller lines. This resulted int he use of simpler and clearer icons with less minute details which actually gave each menu a cleaner look as a whole.


Challenges
======================================================================
One major challenge was working with buffers in the Trivia game project and getting errors filling the buffers with the information we wanted. As soon as we got some funcitonality with that the API we were using was disabled which was another obstacle.

Another challenge was the open trivia api shutting down temporarily. At the time of writing, the api has been down for about a week, and all our trivia depends on the api. It seems as though the lesson here is that it's always risky to depend on a completely separate system for your product to operate at full capacity since you have no control.

The biggest challenge was that this project was very ambitious. However, this could be seen as a positive, since there are so many opportunities to add more and more to the Timagotchi environment. Below is are our intial ideas for what would be in the project:

"Taking inspiration from the [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi), the *Timagotchi* is a multiplayer game that allows the user to 
get a somewhat parodied taste of student life at MIT. To enroll in the virtual MIT of Timagotchis, the user sets up their Timagotchi, giving it a name, major, and extracurricular. 
Once adMITted, the user must make sure to control their Tim’s class schedule, feed it, and help it get through each semester. 
A Timagatchi’s time variant attributes include happiness, hunger, GPA, and money. 
Including the initial user input information, there are other actions that can affect its state: class schedule, UROPs, meals, and mini-game performance. 
The mini-games are ways for the user to contribute to their Timagotchi’s GPA, which will help them advance at MIT. 
Additionally, Timagotchis interact with one another and can help each other. Though not intended to accurately represent every MIT experience, 
the goal of the game is to simulate school/life balance, encourage social collaboration, get through a virtual MIT experience, and have fun!"

We unfortunately missed out on implementing a couple cool extra ideas, such as a voice recognition sign-in, a career fair related game, an email game, and more satirical MIT-related features.
